# Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability please send a message on Discord to Latios#2778.  Ideally try and link to the lines in the code that potentially 
have a problem.  Describe the steps necessary to trigger the vulnerability.  I can then attempt to verify if it is an actual vulnerability, an unintentional bug, or if
the code is working as intended.  Do not publicly disclose possible vulnerabilities as this way there is a chance for it to be fixed.
